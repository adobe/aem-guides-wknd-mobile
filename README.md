# WKND Mobile (AEM Guides)

The WKND Mobile repository supports the AEM Headless tutorial and contains two projects:

* **wknd-mobile.aem**: An AEM multi-module maven project that deploys the baseline application, content and configuration needed to begin the AEM Headless tutorial.
* **wknd-mobile.android**: A Java-based native Android Mobile App that consumes content from the AEM Publish instance that has the **wknd-mobile.aem** artifacts deployed to it.

Note that this code is does not have to built or augmented during the taking of the AEM Headless tutorial, but can be used as a reference for a complete view of how aspects of the tutorial are achieved.

## Supporting AEM Packages

This Github project's [Releases](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-mobile/releases/) contains AEM content packages that contain solutions to various chapters of the AEM Headless tutorial.
